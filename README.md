# Greatest-Python-Prank-Ever
A Prank Script written in Python that is definitely worth it! Just run it and see the fun for yourselves! 

This is a completely safe script and will not do any real damage to your device. It's just a program intended for laughter.

**Instructions**
* Currently works only on Windows 64-bit devices
* Requires Python 3x to be Installed
* Will recommend running it on IDLE Python instead of IDEs like VS Code,PyCharm etc.
* Just don't close anything in the middle! Everything will come to an end eventually.
