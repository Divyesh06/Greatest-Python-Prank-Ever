# Greatest-Python-Prank-Ever
A Prank Script written in Python that is definitely worth it! Just run it and see the fun for yourselves! 

This is a completely safe script and will not do any real damage to your device. It's just a program intended for laughter.

However, if you are still having safety doubts, you can run `Source\decrypyed.py` which has a readable code that you can review first. Although this will ruin some fun :(

**Instructions**
* Only tested on Windows but should work partially on other OS
* Requires Python 3x to be Installed
